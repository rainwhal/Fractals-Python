# GAME 
<p>1. A very simple game in which the 'turtle' is confined in a box where the number of targets are moving randomly. A timer set and a score is maintained. At the end of the 60 seconds the score is displayed.</p>
<p>2. The code of the game has comments which should do the job of explaining the code.</p>
