1. A very simple game in which the 'turtle' is confined in a box where the number of targets are moving randomly. A timer set and a score is maintained. At the end of the 60 seconds the score is displayed.
2. The code of the game has comments which should do the job of explaining the code.

# SNAKE GAME
1. A very common snake game where there is food upon eating which the snake's length increases and the game gets faster hence tougher.
The game is coded from scratch and is not copied from anywhere whatsoever.
P.S. The comments in the code are provided hence the code is very easy to understand.
